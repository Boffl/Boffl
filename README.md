## Hi There

I am a Student of Computational Linguistics at the University of Zurich with a minor in Musicology <br/>

<p> My latest work (my Master's Thesis) focuses on LLMs in digital humanities, with a particular interest in efficient fine-tuning and domain-specific adaptations.</p>

<p>Beyond that, I'm interested in computational musicology, combining my background in musicology with data-driven approaches to analyze and interpret music. I enjoy working on projects that bridge the gap between machine learning, text analysis, and cultural heritage.</p>
