## Hi There

I am a Student of Computational Linguistics at the University of Zurich. <br/>
I combine my major in CL with a minor in Musicology.

### Things I am interested in / working on
<ul>
  <li>
    In an attept to automate my homework assignments, I created this python script, that harmonizes a bass line according to the rules written by
    a French music theorist from the 18th century. It was unfortunatelly never good enough to have saved me time, but I am working on it, you can see my attemt
    in the repo called "figuredBass"
    I have also implemented it in a website, to be able to share it with fellow students of musicology, who not all have experience in running python programs from the
    command line. You can check it out <a href="http://digital-musicology.herokuapp.com/dandrieu/>here</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    With two friends I currently have a project of creating a game based on chatbots that use gpt-3. The idea is that you are organizing a party and have to talk to
    your guests (i.e. the chatbots) in order to keep them entertained. If they get to bored they leave. 
      It is implemented using the game engine Godot. You can check it out in the repo "language-game-prototype".
  </li>
