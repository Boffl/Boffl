## Hi There

I am a Student of Computational Linguistics at the University of Zurich. <br/>
I combine my major in CL with a minor in Musicology.

<p>I’m passionate about the intersection of language models and society, exploring both their practical applications and their broader implications. My latest work focuses on LLMs in digital humanities, with a particular interest in efficient fine-tuning and domain-specific adaptations.</p>

							<p>Beyond that, I'm interested in computational musicology, combining my background in musicology with data-driven approaches to analyze and interpret music. I enjoy working on projects that bridge the gap between machine learning, text analysis, and cultural heritage.</p>
